----------

Instruction through Codio is built around the guides feature. This is a brief description on how the demo on the previous page was built. Please see the [**documentation**](https://docs.codio.com/authoring.html) for more information about content authoring with guides.

### Build on this Starter Pack
---
Please note that there are softwares, files, scripts, etc. preconfigured in this **Hello Turtle in Java** Starter Pack that allow for use of turtle in Java. 

* `turtle.sh` file is a Bash script that allows for efficient operations on multiple files in the command line. 
* `Turtle.java` is called to enable the Turtle Graphics library.
* `turtle.cfg` contains the coordinates for the starting location of the turtle window in the pane.

Follow the directions below to build out this project with your own activities in turtle:

### Code Editor File
---
Add a `.java` file to this project. This is the file students will edit. Right-click on the name of your project or book in the directory tree on the left. Select `New File...` and then type its name and file extension. Copy and paste the following template code into the new file.

```
public class filename {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
	
  }
}
```

### Page Layout
---
Each page in the guide can have its own layout. You can select how many panels you want, and what information goes in each panel. Click the wrench in the top-right corner of your guide. You can select the layout from here. 

When setting up Turtle Graphics, set the code editor file in panel 0, and the server in panel 1. The guide will be in panel 2.
